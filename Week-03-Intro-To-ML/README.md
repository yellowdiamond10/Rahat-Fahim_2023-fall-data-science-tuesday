__There are two main types of projects, a data visualization type and a model / classifier type.__

[Here are some examples of past awesome projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cP4daoojG4o5ia246W91KzWf0i8qAccgtysZetmhjsU/edit#heading=h.yv43a3abdrly)


Over the course of this semester, you will be working **in groups of 3** to develop one Data Science project together that you will demo at the end of the semester on Demo Night.

To help us form groups, I would like each of you to: 
1.  __list your interests__, 
0. __think of at least one project idea__ (you can totally change it later), 
0. __and pick out any 3  datasets that interests you__  

You're project idea can and probablly will change. This will help you form groups by finding common interests. (Once you have formed teams, you will discuss, choose, and refine your proposals further. Each team will develop a single data science project.) 

If you do not have your own idea, it is okay to do a Kaggle competition or piggyback on another data science project that has already been done.  __But youâ€™ve got to give credit / source them and change it enough so its your own project.__  

__***Next week we will all review all the slides together, so make sure you fill yours out by next week.***__
